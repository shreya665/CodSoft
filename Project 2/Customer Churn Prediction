PROJECT - CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTIONM SYSTEM

AIM - The churn prediction model is built using a combination of supervised machine learning algorithms. It aims to identify customers who are likely to leave based on historical data.

KEY STEPS INCLUDE -

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for model training.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features that help the model better predict churn.

Model Training: Training various machine learning models and selecting the best performing one.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Deployment: Saving the model and providing scripts for deployment in a production environment.

CONCLUSION-

In this project, we successfully developed a machine learning model for predicting customer churn. By analyzing customer data, engineering relevant features, and training various models, we achieved a robust solution capable of identifying at-risk customers.
