PROJECT - CREDIT CARD FRAUDDETECTIONM SYSTEM

AIM - The fraud detection model is built using a combination of supervised machine learning algorithms. It aims to identify fraudulent transactions based on historical transaction data.

KEY STEPS INCLUDE -

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for model training.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features that help the model better distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

Model Training: Training various machine learning models and selecting the best performing one.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Deployment: Saving the model and providing scripts for deployment in a production environment.

CONCLUSION-

In this project, we successfully developed a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. Through meticulous data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, we achieved a robust solution capable of distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent activities.
